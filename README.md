# Readme Generator


## Description
A  README generator that quickly creates a professional README for a new project.

## Usage
In a command-line application that accepts user input a user is prompted for information about their application repository.
Then a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of the project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.
When the project title in entered it is then displayed as the title of the README.
When a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions are entered, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.
WHEN a license for my application from a list of options is selected, then a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.
WHEN the links in the Table of Contents are clicked, they go to the corresponding section of the README.
